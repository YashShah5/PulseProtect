# Dataset
The Heart Disease prediction dataset is a collection of medical and demographic data from patients, along with their percentage risk. 

### Dataset Features
The dataset includes several key features:
- Age
- Gender
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Hypertension
- Heart Disease
- Smoking History
- HbA1c Level
- Blood Glucose Level

## Applications
The **Heart Disease Prediction** dataset is primarily used to build machine learning models that predict diabetes in patients based on their comprehensive medical histories and demographic information. This tool is essential for:
- **Healthcare Professionals**: To identify patients at risk of developing diabetes and to create personalized treatment plans.
- **Researchers**: To explore correlations between various medical conditions and demographic factors, and the development of diabetes.
